# PM Skills Marketplace: Structured AI Workflows for Better Product Decisions

> A structured operating system for product managers using AI.  
> 65 domain-specific skills and 36 chained workflows across 8 PM plugins — from discovery to strategy, execution, launch, and growth.

![Plugin overview](plugins-overview.webp)

## Start Here

New idea? → `/discover`  
Need strategic clarity? → `/strategy`  
Writing a PRD? → `/write-prd`  
Planning a launch? → `/plan-launch`  
Defining metrics? → `/north-star`

If this project helps you, ⭐ the repo.

## Why PM Skills Marketplace?

Most AI tools make PMs faster at writing.

PM Skills Marketplace makes you better at deciding.

- Discovery before solutioning  
- Assumption mapping before roadmap commitments  
- Prioritization tied to impact and risk  
- North Star clarity before metric theater  
- Pre-mortems before launch disasters  

This isn’t about generating text.
It’s about product judgment.

## Installation

### Claude Cowork (recommended for non-developers)

1. Open **Customize** (bottom-left)
2. Go to **Browse plugins** → **Personal** → **+**
3. Select **Add marketplace from GitHub**
4. Enter: `phuryn/pm-skills`

All 8 plugins install automatically. You get both commands (`/discover`, `/strategy`, etc.) and skills.

For a full walkthrough, see [Claude Cowork: The Ultimate Guide for PMs](https://www.productcompass.pm/p/claude-cowork-guide).

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude plugin add --marketplace phuryn/pm-skills
```

### Other AI assistants (skills only)

The `skills/*/SKILL.md` files follow the universal skill format and work with any tool that reads it. Commands (`/slash-commands`) are Claude-specific.

| Tool | How to use | What works |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Gemini CLI** | Copy skill folders to `.gemini/skills/` | Skills only |
| **Cursor** | Copy skill folders to `.cursor/skills/` | Skills only |
| **Codex CLI** | Copy skill folders to `.codex/skills/` | Skills only |
| **Kiro** | Copy skill folders to `.kiro/skills/` | Skills only |

```bash
# Example: copy all skills for Gemini CLI
for plugin in pm-*/; do
  cp -r "$plugin/skills/"* ~/.gemini/skills/ 2>/dev/null
done
```

## Skills, Commands, and Plugins

**Skills** are the building blocks of the marketplace. Each skill gives Claude domain knowledge, analytical frameworks, or a guided workflow for a specific PM task. Skills are loaded automatically when relevant to the conversation — no explicit invocation needed. Some skills also work as reusable foundations that multiple commands share.

**Commands** are user-triggered workflows invoked with `/command-name`. They chain one or more skills into an end-to-end process. For example, `/discover` chains four skills together: brainstorm-ideas → identify-assumptions → prioritize-assumptions → brainstorm-experiments.

**Plugins** group related skills and commands into installable packages. Each plugin covers a PM domain — discovery, strategy, execution, and so on. Installing the marketplace gives you all 8 plugins at once.

Commands use skills. Some skills serve multiple commands. Some skills (like `prioritization-frameworks` or `opportunity-solution-tree`) are standalone references that Claude draws on whenever relevant — no command needed.

Commands are designed to flow into each other, matching the PM workflow:

```
/strategy → /business-model → /pricing
     ↓
/discover → /brainstorm → /write-prd → /write-stories → /sprint plan
     ↓              ↓           ↓
/interview    /triage-requests  /pre-mortem
     ↓
/research-users → /analyze-feedback
                       ↓
/plan-launch → /growth-strategy → /battlecard
     ↓
/market-product → /north-star → /setup-metrics
```

After any command completes, it suggests relevant next commands — just follow the prompts.
